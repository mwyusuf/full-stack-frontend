## Introduction
### What is Fullstack
Someone who can build an application from start to finish, including front end and backend.

## Understanding the Internet
It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) [5]. TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter which device you're using or where you're using it. Basically a series of system globally interconnected devices. Not to be confused with intranet, which basically internet but private.

## Servers
It serves content and also respond request, it serves something back.

```sh
yusuf@Yusufs-MacBook-Pro full-stack-frontend % node simpleServer.js 
Server started! listening on port 8080
```

## SSH
The Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. SSH applications are based on a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.

```sh
yusuf@Yusufs-MacBook-Pro .ssh % ls
id_rsa		id_rsa.pub	known_hosts
yusuf@Yusufs-MacBook-Pro .ssh % vim id_rsa
yusuf@Yusufs-MacBook-Pro .ssh % vim id_rsa.pub
```
